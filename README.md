# Auto Encoder

Autoencoder is a neural network that tries to reconstruct input.

- An Autoencoder is a form of feature extraction algorithm.

- Autoencoders can be stacked.

- The output of an autoencoder is the middle layer, the representation for each data point.

The project explains the steps to build an autoencoder by using keras with backend tensorflow to train autoencoder model and using deep learning to enhance the quality of an image.

Project overview:
- Build the Encoder

- Build the Decoder to Complete the Network

- Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine

- Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model

- Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
